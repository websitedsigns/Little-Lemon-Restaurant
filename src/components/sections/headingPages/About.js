                <p className="about-subtext">Little Lemon opened in 2021 by two Italian brothers, Luigi and Mario. 
                Despite the city's diversity, the two brothers recognized the lack of Mediterranean cuisine in London, 
                and were inspired to bring the flavors of their hometown in Italy to the people of London. The two brothers 
                plan to introduce Little Lemon to more cities across the country.</p>
